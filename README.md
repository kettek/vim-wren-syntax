# Vim Wren Syntax
These files provide some Vim syntax for [wren](http://wren.io/), a small, fast, and class-based scripting language and VM.

**NOTE**: The syntax files are very incomplete and only give some base syntax coloring. More will be done in the future, but my immediate focus is only on minor separation of types, expressions, comments, etc.

## Installation
Installation can be done with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (or manually):

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/kettek/vim-wren-syntax.git
```
